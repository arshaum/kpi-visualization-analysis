# 📊 KPI Insights & Strategic Analysis

This project presents a series of curated key performance indicators (KPIs) supported by detailed visualizations and qualitative insights. Developed during my internship, the goal was to help guide data-driven decisions across departments through clear, contextual, and actionable analysis.

## ✅ Objective
To transform raw operational data into strategic insights through data storytelling, combining quantitative visuals with qualitative explanations for maximum clarity and impact.

## 🧰 Tools & Methods
- **Google Sheets**: Data cleaning, aggregation, and visualization
- **Google Docs**: Structured narrative of insights with embedded charts
- **Analytical Methods**: Trend analysis, YoY comparisons, ratio metrics, and departmental performance tracking

## 🔍 Highlights
- **Visual Dashboards**: Created clean, understandable charts to represent KPIs
- **Narrative Analysis**: Wrote qualitative summaries for each visual, explaining trends and their implications
- **Decision Support**: Each section connects data with recommendations or strategic takeaways

## 🔐 Security Note
To ensure confidentiality and respect data sensitivity, all charts embedded in the shared Google Doc have been **unlinked** from their original data sources. This ensures no private or proprietary information is shared.
